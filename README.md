TDT4102
=======

Most of my exercises for the course TDT4102 Object Oriented Programming in C++

NOTE 1: If some of the code doesn't make sense, particularly in the various main()-functions, it's because I
added it just for testing/debugging purposes.

Note 2: Some of the code in exercise 4, particularly in the dealHand()-function, is not implemented correctly.
Setting the size of a static array in C++ after compile-time is generally not allowed, and only works in this case 
becuase the gcc-compiler is way too kind. The same code will not work on neither Windows nor Mac.
